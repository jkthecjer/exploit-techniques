# use after free

This writeup describes the exploitation of a "use after free" vulnerability in the heap management of a target program.  This vulnerability typically occurs when a heap chunk is allocated with an intended use-case (ex: hardcoded function pointer), free'd, allocated again and modified for a different purpose (ex: user-controlled string buffer), but still (mistakenly) seen as a valid chunk for that original use-case.  Weaponizing of these vulnerabilities is pretty dependent on the program itself and the data structures of the before and after views into these chunks.  Exploiting these vulnerabilities does not necessarily rely on corrupting heap metadata like other heap expoitation techniques do (double frees, for example).  In this way, exploiting these vulnerability has a similar target-specific feel as buffer overflowing local variables on the stack (without corrupting a return pointer or saved frame pointer).
